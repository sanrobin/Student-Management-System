# Student-Management-System
A small Python project done for my 12th Practical Examinations
# Installation
Just import the .sql files in the DB folder
# Credits
Even though the code is entirely done by myself, I would not have done this if my CS teacher didnt challenge me to do this. It took me 6 months to learn and write this code. I also thank my friends who helped me to write this code without any problems.
# If anyone wants to use this project, you can use it. If you need help, you can contact me via Discord - @phoenixphan0_
